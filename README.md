## Front-end challenge #

Challenge: Write an online calculator with HTML5 technologies, preferably as single page
application. Try to build the calculator visually and functionally as close as possible to the
famous CASIO SL-300SV Model.

### Important Notes: ###

* Try to build the calculator with front-end and HTML5 best practices
* You may choose any JS/CSS frameworks you prefer or familiar with
* The behavior and visual appearance of the digital display is important to us
* Try to make sure that calculation logic and visual interaction are independent
* The challenge is not timed and on average it takes people 90 to 120 minutes to complete. That said, you can put as much time into the challenge as you would like, and exceptional results may take more (or less) time to complete. We ask that you return the assignment in the next week.

Thank you and all the best!
